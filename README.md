# VALFE08 ( Vishwa's Android Log File Extractor )

VALFE08 (Vishwa's Android Log File Extractor) is a utility tool, which enables users to acquire forensic data from android devices in a simpler manner.

It is a CLI-based utility tool that uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to extract relevant forensic log files from an android device.

## How to use

_Note:_
**VALFE08 is not ready for production yet** and it is only tested on Windows as of now.

<!-- _Note:_
 Please read the DISCLAIMER before using the tool. -->

Prepackaged binary for Windows is available in the releases section if you are interested (checksum are provided as well for the executables). However, I will happy if you test it out on your device and help with the project.

### Requirements

The following are required to run the source code/VALFE08,

1. Python 3.11.1 and PIP 22.3.1
2. ADB

ADB is necessary for VALFE08 to work. Download and Install ADB from the [official source](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads) and the same to the system path.

VALFE08 also requires the target android device to be connected via USB in debugging mode. For this to work, one needs to enable USB debugging and accept the correct RSA Fingerprint prompted on the android device, to validate the connection. You can read more about enabling USB Debugging in your android device [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable).

_Note:_
Enabling USB debugging may vary from device to device, please have a glance at your device manufacturer's device manual to know more.

Please see [requirements](https://github.com/code-reaper08/VALFE08/blob/main/requirements.txt) for additional packages to install.

Instead of manually installing the packages, it is highly recommended to install from the [requirements](https://github.com/code-reaper08/VALFE08/blob/main/requirements.txt) file using the below command from the root directory.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all the requirements are downloaded and installed, you can use VALFE08 by directly executing it with python.

```bash
python genisis.py
```

## Downloding and Installing VALFE08

VALFE08's source code can be run by following [these instructions](https://github.com/code-reaper08/VALFE08#how-to-use), however, for a very non-techy user, it might still pose some groundwork in installing the necessary tools and environment to run VALFE08. To ease this, such users can use the official VALFE08 installer script provided in this repository.

### What the installer script does

The installer scripts download ADB and VALFE08 and create a session-level environment for executing VALFE08. It means the ADB you've installed through the script will be available to VALFE08 for the current ongoing PowerShell session only and will be unavailable when closing the PowerShell window. It is indeed good in many ways by not cluterring the system environment. However, if you want the ADB to be global and persistent, you can always add the `platform-tools` directory to the system path.

**Windows**

To use the script follow the below steps,

1. Download the installer script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-reaper08/VALFE08/main/scripts/install.ps1)
2. Run the downloaded script in PowerShell by `.\installer.ps1`
3. Or, you can click on the installed script and then click on the open with PowerShell option

_Note:_
When prompted about changing the execution policy in PowerShell for running the script, do so to run the script. You can also use the below command in powershell to bypass execution policy in a file-level scope.

`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer.ps1`

## Encryption in VALFE08

VALFE08 by default encrypts the extracted log files for ensuring file integrity. It is advised not to tamper with file structures so that the decryption process is carried out efficiently. Each run of VALFE08 produces a `filekey.key`, this key must be handled with care since it is symmetric. Though in most cases immediate decryption is preferred, there's an option to decrypt later as well. When choosing the decrypt later option, the filekey.key should be securely held and it is the user's responsibility to do so.

### VALFE-Decryptor

It is a decryption entity, which takes care of decrypting the encrypted extracted files. By Nature VALFE-Decryptor needs `filekey.key`, `specimen/` directory, and locked files inside it to start the decryption process. So when decrypting please ensure the above criteria are met.
